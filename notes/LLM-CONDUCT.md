# LLM Conduct Log

Per the challenge requirement, this file records where and how an LLM (Claude
Code) was used during this work, in the spirit of "use LLMs as you would in
daily work, and document it."

How to read: one dated entry per working session — what the LLM was used for,
and anything notable (decisions it surfaced, where its output was corrected or
overridden, what was done by hand).

---

## 2026-05-29 — Foundations: planning + Terraform scaffolding

- **Used for:** Expanding the Mon Jun 1 "Foundations" plan into a concrete
  design, then scaffolding the repo tree and the Terraform foundation
  (bootstrap state backend, reusable modules, layered dev environment).
- **Notable / human decisions:**
  - State layout chosen by me as **Lee-Briggs layered** (separate state per
    layer, per environment) over a single composed root — for operational
    maturity. The LLM presented the trade-offs.
  - Runtime set to **AWS Graviton (m6g / arm64)**; the LLM flagged the arm64
    knock-on effects (AMI, k3s, container/Helm image arch, ECR pull-through).
  - Conventions seeded from my own `ryderdain/tw-project` (resource `"this"`
    naming, community `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws`, `TF_VAR_mycurrentip`
    SSH-lockdown pattern, `eu-central-1`).
  - No `tofu apply` run — scaffolding only, per the billing guardrail.

## 2026-06-01 — Spec + plan iteration; scope additions

- **Used for:** Reviewing the (separately-generated) `PLAN.md`, authoring
  `SPEC.md` as the living end-design spec mapped to `TASK.md`, and rebalancing
  the schedule around a hard **16:00 CEST Wed 10 Jun** delivery.
- **Notable / human decisions:**
  - Two scope additions decided by me to make the submission stand out:
    **(1) constrained-identity deployment** (agents/CI assume least-priv roles
    via OIDC, no static creds) and **(2) operator/CI toolbox container +
    cloud-init bootstrap VM** (session-timeout-proof long ops, no toolchain drift).
  - **IdP decision (cost basis, time vs money):** chose **native AWS OIDC +
    IAM Identity Center** now (feasible same-evening, $0) over self-hosting
    **Ory Hydra** (~1–3 days, portable). Ory kept as the documented portable
    production recommendation — consistent with the repo's ECR→Harbor pattern.
    The LLM produced the time/money comparison; I made the call.
  - **Toolbox delivery:** container + cloud-init VM now; Packer AMI documented
    as the immutable prod path.
  - LLM proposed the "cloud-native-for-demo, portable-OSS-for-prod" narrative
    thread (ECR→Harbor, AWS OIDC→Ory, cloud-init→Packer); I accepted it.
  - Still no `tofu apply` — identity bootstrap (first billable apply) is queued
    for the evening, pending in-chat confirmation.
  - Built `terraform/identity/` (GitHub Actions OIDC provider + scoped
    `tofu-plan`/`tofu-apply` roles); Identity Center left as a documented manual
    prerequisite (not enabled in the account).
  - **My directive:** customer-managed KMS keys only (no AWS-managed default
    keys) — applied to state (bootstrap), ECR, and EBS; LLM wired the matching
    `tofu-plan` KMS grant and flagged the ~$1/mo-per-key cost.
  - Added living runbooks `docs/{BOOTSTRAP,UPGRADE,RECOVERY,TEARDOWN}.md`
    (TEARDOWN suggested by the LLM, accepted; ACCESS/SCALING proposed).

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — Docs consolidation + secrets-hygiene fix

- **Used for:** Restructuring documentation around a single front-door README,
  authoring the `ACCESS.md` onboarding runbook, and a git secrets-hygiene sweep.
- **Notable / human decisions:**
  - **My directive:** the **top-level `README.md` is the primary doc**; removed all
    per-directory leaf READMEs (cognitive noise) and folded their content into the
    README / runbooks / `SPEC.md`. Recorded the convention in `CLAUDE.md` so it
    survives compaction. LLM migrated the load-bearing content and fixed dangling links.
  - **Scaling + backups are automated** (HPA / CNPG `.spec.instances` / Terraform
    node count; CNPG→S3 continuous+scheduled) and documented in the README — I
    declined a separate `SCALING.md` runbook. `ACCESS.md` written as a runbook.
  - **Secrets leak caught by the LLM:** `environments/dev/backend.hcl` was tracked
    from the initial commit, so `.gitignore` couldn't hide it and the real account
    id was staged to ship. Fixed via `git rm --cached` (working copy retained) +
    committed `.example` templates. Verified `terraform/identity/` real
    `backend.hcl`/`terraform.tfvars` are ignored before the whole-tree commit.
  - Moved this log to the repo root (`LLM-CONDUCT.md`) alongside the README.
  - Still no `tofu apply` — bootstrap apply remains gated on in-chat confirmation.

## 2026-06-02 — Live infra bring-up, Ansible roles, operator toolbox

- **Used for:** First billable applies (dev layers `10→50` under the assumed
  `brzl-tofu-apply` role), writing the Ansible `base`/`security` roles + the
  inventory generator, and building the operator/CI toolbox + bootstrap-VM
  containers.
- **Notable / human decisions:**
  - **My directive:** run *everything* under the assumed least-priv role; only
    `terraform/identity/` perm changes run as my own principal, and blockers
    loop back to widen the role. The constrained-identity model held — no
    loop-backs needed.
  - **Spot reclaim, real-world:** the `capacity_type=spot` bring-up was reclaimed
    within minutes (eu-central-1 pressure). I switched to **on-demand**; the
    toggle the LLM had built did its job. Good signal for the write-up.
  - **SSH key handling corrected by me:** the LLM's first instinct was a
    user-supplied key var; I redirected it to my `tw-project` TF-generated
    keypair pattern (`tls_private_key`→`aws_key_pair`→`local_sensitive_file`),
    owned by the `50-compute` layer.
  - **EBS CMK cost:** I flagged that the per-iteration CMK churn costs ~$1 each
    replay; shortened the deletion window to 7d as a stopgap and logged "move the
    CMK to a persistent layer" to the backlog. Teardown gated on my question first.
  - **Toolbox base + pins (my call):** bump to `python:3.14-slim-trixie` and pin
    Python/Debian to ~2030 EoL series — the LLM had pinned `ansible-core` 2.20
    against bookworm's Python 3.11 (incompatible); the live build caught it.
  - **Container user rename (my call):** `operator`→`opagent` (reusable beyond
    this project; also sidesteps a Debian system-group collision the build hit).
  - **Supply-chain (my directive):** vendor + GPG-verify AWS's signing keys
    (aws-cli, and later the session-manager-plugin) rather than TLS-only trust;
    the LLM had defaulted to "pin + document the gap" for the plugin until it
    found AWS publishes a `.sig`.
  - Bash discipline enforced: I challenged a `set -eux`; confirmed it's justified
    only in Dockerfile `RUN`s, with explicit return-code checks in standalone
    scripts (per `CLAUDE.md` / BashPitfalls).

## 2026-06-02 (cont.) — SSM keyless node access: design, build, live test

- **Used for:** Designing and building **SSM Session Manager** node access,
  then a full live end-to-end test (bring-up → bootstrap → teardown).
- **Notable / human decisions:**
  - **Rejected the LLM's over-engineered default (key correction):** the LLM
    proposed the Ansible `aws_ssm` connection plugin, which needs an S3
    file-transfer bucket, and even spun up a "where should the bucket live"
    decision. I pushed back — SSM Session Manager needs no bucket — and had it
    explain the mechanic (the bucket is the *plugin's* file-copy hack, not an SSM
    requirement; ArgoCD never touches nodes; SSM connectivity uses no customer
    S3). We chose **SSH-over-SSM** (ProxyCommand tunnel): no bucket, ordinary
    Ansible semantics, lower cognitive overhead for junior operators. The key
    stays as break-glass only.
  - Threaded the change into existing layers (no new layer): `:22` ingress made
    optional and set off in `20-security`; inline SSM policy on the node role in
    `30-iam`; inventory keyed by instance-id; `session-manager-plugin` added to
    the toolbox (GPG-verified against AWS's distinct plugin key, which I supplied).
  - **Live test caught three LLM bugs that only surface by running it:**
    (1) ssh tripped `MaxAuthTries` because ssh-agent keys were offered first →
    added `IdentitiesOnly=yes`; (2) the `yaml` stdout callback was removed in
    community.general 12 → switched to the builtin `result_format=yaml`;
    (3) the `base` role assumed `systemd-timesyncd`, but the AMI uses chrony.
  - **Cloud-agnostic NTP (my catch):** when the LLM moved to "just enable
    chrony," I caught that chrony was syncing to AWS's `169.254.169.123` (a
    cloud-init drop-in). Per TASK.md's provider-neutral goal I directed: drop the
    AWS source, disable cloud-init's NTP module, and use the vendor-neutral
    `pool.ntp.org`. Verified live (no `169.254.x` source).
  - **Result:** SSH-over-SSM proven with zero inbound `:22`; `base`+`security`
    roles green and idempotent; sshd hardening applied without lockout.
  - **Teardown discipline (my directive):** retain all KMS keys (cheaper to keep
    than replay). The LLM did an **instances-only `-target` destroy**, leaving the
    EBS CMK `Enabled` (first iteration with no CMK churn); NAT/network/state kept.
  - Guardrails honored throughout: every billable apply/destroy used the
    saved-plan workflow and a per-step in-chat confirmation.

## 2026-06-03 — k3s HA role, docs reorg, operator toolbox + iteration tools

- **Used for:** Authoring the `kubernetes` Ansible role (k3s HA, 3-server
  embedded etcd) and live-verifying it end-to-end; reorganizing the docs
  (delivery-facing `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` + ADR log, SPEC.md demoted to internal
  gitignored scratchpad); making the operator toolbox functional in-cluster and
  baking its build into the 40-ecr layer; generating `gitops/tools/` helpers.
- **Notable / human decisions:**
  - **SPEC↔ARCHITECTURE split (my directive):** "SPEC iterates, ARCHITECTURE
    curates" — SPEC.md stays the internal scratchpad where decisions land first;
    `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the curated delivery doc with a running ADR log.
    SPEC.md gitignored alongside PLAN/TASK; git presence is a signal to LLM.
  - **EKS nuance I added to ADR-0001 / "Why k3s":** a core value-add of the original vendor is
    running secure workloads in public cloud *even on managed control planes*
    (EKS control-plane nodes are ostensibly patchable) — so managed k8s isn't
    categorically off the table. k3s still the right call here (time + it's a
    plausible target for its own software). Flagged as a revisit
    consideration rather than a closed door.
  - **Live test caught three LLM bugs that only surface by running it:**
    (1) the install guard checked `k3s --version`, but the role vendors the
    binary *before* the check, so install was always skipped → switched to
    testing for the systemd unit; (2) `command` module word-split the
    `jsonpath={range …}` form; (3) shlex stripped the quotes around `"Ready"`
    → fixed both with the `argv` list form. Verified 3/3 Ready + idempotent.
  - **Toolbox baked into IaC as a self-validating check (my directive):** the
    40-ecr apply builds + pushes + verifies the toolbox image via a
    `terraform_data` local-exec, so a green apply *is* the e2e proof. Content-
    addressed tag (sha256 of build inputs) because ECR repos are IMMUTABLE — a
    rolling `latest` could only be pushed once. Image source for in-cluster use:
    ECR + an auto-refreshed (~12h) pull-secret bound to a `toolbox` SA.
  - LLM caught `kubectl run --serviceaccount` was removed in newer kubectl →
    switched to `--overrides` for `serviceAccountName`.
  - **Naming convention I set:** snake_case for script filenames *and*
    variable/identifier names across all code, unless a stronger language
    convention governs (Go MixedCaps, k8s manifest keys camelCase). Recorded in
    CLAUDE.md; backlog item to rename `generate-inventory.sh`.
  - **EBS CSI re-sequenced (my choice):** deliver EBS CSI + gp3 default
    StorageClass as a GitOps wave-0 infrastructure Application under ArgoCD, not
    a standalone install — honors the "delegate k8s config to ArgoCD" decision.
  - Guardrails honored: billable applies used the saved-plan workflow with
    per-step in-chat confirmation; git commits left for me to finalize + push.

## 2026-06-03 (cont.) — ArgoCD app-of-apps scaffolding + ECR pull-through extension

- **Used for:** Scaffolding the GitOps layer — ArgoCD app-of-apps (root +
  `brzl-dev` AppProject + sync-wave-ordered child apps), the wave-0 EBS CSI +
  gp3 default StorageClass app, ArgoCD self-management, the one-time Helm
  bootstrap script + repo deploy-key `.example`, and extending the ECR
  pull-through cache (quay.io + ghcr.io) with the node-role import perms.
  Docs: ADR-0013, ADR-0008 update, SPEC decisions 7–10, README doc-map.
- **Notable / human decisions (I chose, via the question prompt):**
  - **Private-repo auth = read-only GitHub deploy key** (not a PAT, not public)
    — narrowest blast radius; the private key stays in a gitignored Secret.
  - **Extend ECR pull-through to quay/ghcr now** (vs. pulling upstream + deferring)
    — keeps the "images via ECR" supply-chain story whole; cost is per-upstream
    Secrets Manager credential secrets + create-on-pull IAM perms, surfaced as a
    gated apply.
  - **ArgoCD bootstrapped via Helm then self-manages** (vs. raw manifests) — argo
    upgrades become git diffs.
- **LLM-surfaced gotchas I had it design around:**
  - Pull-through create-on-pull needs `ecr:CreateRepository` +
    `ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage` on the *pulling* principal — the node role only
    had read perms (never bit us yet because k3s installs via Ansible, not ECR).
    Scoped the new perms to the `brzl-dev-*` cache prefixes.
  - quay.io **and** ghcr.io both require authenticated pull-through (ghcr even for
    public packages) — mirrored the existing credential-ARN-gated Docker Hub rule.
  - **Account-id-in-git tension:** ArgoCD reads manifests only from git, but the
    ECR host carries the account id (our hygiene rule gitignores account-bearing
    values). Resolved with a `__ECR_REGISTRY_HOST__` sentinel (account-agnostic
    deliverable) resolved via `helm --set` at bootstrap; documented the clean prod
    fixes (ApplicationSet cluster-generator value, or Harbor's account-less host).
- **Scope / guardrails:** pure scaffolding — *no* billable apply run. The
  Terraform pull-through/IAM changes (`tofu fmt` clean) and the one-time helm
  install are gated behind explicit confirmation + the upstream credential
  secrets. Helm chart versions pinned (argo-cd 7.7.0, aws-ebs-csi-driver 2.37.0);
  bootstrap script shellcheck-clean, snake_case per CLAUDE.md.

## 2026-06-03 (cont. 2) — local kubeconfig tool + secret-store decision

- **Used for:** A `gitops/tools/kubeconfig_setup.sh` helper (reuse the fetched
  admin creds, re-resolve the current primary endpoint via `tofu output`, rename
  to an `brzl-dev` context, merge into `~/.kube/config` with a backup); and
  reworking the GitOps secret/config story.
- **Secret-store course-correction (human):** I briefly asked to keep the
  quay/ghcr creds + ECR host in **GitHub repo Secrets** (GitHub as source of
  truth), then withdrew it as "wrong-headed." The LLM had surfaced the blockers:
  GitHub repo Secrets are **write-only** (only readable inside a GitHub Actions
  run), and ECR pull-through's `credential_arn` **can't** reference them anyway.
  Landed on: **Secrets Manager** for the pull-through creds (required; prefix
  `ecr-pullthroughcache/`), **SSM Parameter Store** for the non-secret ECR host
  (`/brzl-dev/ecr/registry_host`), and a general "Parameter Store for non-secret
  config when reasonable" preference.
- **Built around it:** SSM param in the ecr module; bootstrap resolves the host
  from Param Store (STS fallback); `create_pullthrough_secrets.sh` emit-commands
  helper that references the tokens as runtime `$VAR`s so a dry run never prints
  them (leak-checked). Documented the narrow ADR-0006 exception (these upstream-
  token secrets default to the AWS-managed Secrets Manager key; a CMK would need
  an ECR-service decrypt grant).
- **Guardrails:** still no billable/mutating run — Secrets Manager creation,
  30-iam/40-ecr applies, and the helm bootstrap remain gated on confirmation +
  real credentials. `tofu fmt` clean, ecr module `validate` passes, both new
  scripts shellcheck-clean.

## 2026-06-03 (cont. 3) — node→ECR auth + ArgoCD up (live, billable)

- **Used for:** First live execution of the GitOps path: applied `30-iam`
  (pull-through import perms) and `40-ecr` (cache rules + SSM host param) via the
  saved-plan workflow, generated + registered the ArgoCD deploy key, added a
  kubelet **ECR credential provider** to the Ansible k3s role and ran it, then
  helm-installed ArgoCD pulling its image through ECR — proving the chain.
- **Standing permission set (human):** `tofu plan` is now pre-authorized (read-
  only); apply/destroy + other mutations stay gated. Saved to memory.
- **Two AWS realities the run surfaced:**
  - **quay.io pull-through needs NO credential** — ECR rejected the credential_arn
    with `UnsupportedUpstreamRegistryException` ("doesn't require authentication").
    Reworked the quay rule to be credential-free (like registry.k8s.io); the
    operator's quay robot account turned out unnecessary (ghcr still needs auth).
    Good reminder to verify per-upstream auth rather than assume uniformity.
  - **Nodes didn't authenticate to ECR at all** — the toolbox had masked this with
    a manual pull-secret. Pods couldn't have pulled ECR-cached images. Fixed
    properly with the kubelet credential provider (vendored `ecr-credential-provider`
    v1.31.7, pinned sha256 per arch, instance-profile auth, no rotating secrets),
    wired via `/etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml` kubelet-arg + a **throttle:1 rolling
    restart** that blocks on each node's `/readyz` to keep etcd quorum.
- **Validated end-to-end:** all 6 ArgoCD pods Running; image resolves to
  `…/brzl-dev-quay/argoproj/argocd:v2.13.0`; the `brzl-dev-quay/argoproj/argocd`
  cache repo was auto-created on first pull (create-on-pull perms confirmed).
- **Deferred (tomorrow):** GitHub wiring — commit/push `gitops/`, apply
  deploy-key Secret + AppProject + app-of-apps root, resolve the host sentinel,
  watch EBS-CSI/gp3 then CNPG sync. ArgoCD is a plain helm release until the
  self-manage app adopts it.
- **Process notes:** ansible-lint clean (production profile); the deliberate
  `shell` restart is `# noqa`'d with a quorum-safety rationale. Unused quay
  Secrets Manager secret left as a trivial teardown-sweep note.

## 2026-06-04 — EBS-CMK migration, demo app, ESO secret projection, local-dev decision

- **Used for:** Four threads, all under the assumed `brzl-tofu-apply` role where
  AWS was touched.
- **EBS-CMK state migration (live, no resource change):** `state rm` of the EBS
  CMK + alias from `50-compute` and `import` into the persistent `15-kms` layer
  (`module.kms_ebs`), completing the ADR-0006 move. Verified plans: `15-kms` = 9
  add / 1 in-place (deletion_window 7→30) / **0 destroy**; `50-compute` = no key
  destroy. Physical key `4805a479…` untouched (no re-encrypt). Synced `UPGRADE.md`
  and PLAN; `15-kms apply` is now an ordinary bring-up step, no surgical targeting.
- **Demo REST app (`apps/demo-app`):** LLM-drafted **Go + pgx** on
  **distroless/static:nonroot**, arm64, 18.7 MB. `/healthz` (no DB) + `/readyz`
  (DB ping + schema-ready flag), `GET/POST /items`, idempotent schema with
  capped-backoff retry, graceful SIGTERM drain, slog JSON. **Verified by running
  it** — natively *and* as the built container against a throwaway PG17: full
  read/write round-trip, correct 200/201/400/503, and the startup retry caught a
  real cold-DB race live. `go vet` clean, shellcheck-clean `build_push.sh`.
- **Secret projection via External Secrets Operator (ADR-0014):** decision made
  *with the human* (own-`demo`-namespace + ESO over same-namespace / reflector /
  synced-secret). Built the wave-1 ESO app + a least-priv reader SA/RBAC →
  `ClusterSecretStore` → `ExternalSecret`. **Caught an LLM-plausible bug by
  reasoning about DNS:** CNPG's `uri` embeds the short `pg-rw` host (unresolvable
  cross-namespace) — reworked ESO to *template* the DSN with the FQDN +
  `sslmode=require`. De-risked offline with `helm template` (chart 0.10.7 renders,
  values keys honored, serves `v1beta1`).
- **Local-dev (k3d) viability — analysed, deferred by decision (ADR-0015):**
  judged it viable + cheap (k3d = same k3s, `local-path` already a documented
  lever) but a *built+tested* path would eat the delivery buffer; recorded
  design-only now (ADR + overlay-ready manifests), build is post-delivery /
  spare-buffer-only-if-ahead. Human chose the deferral.
- **Docs/drift:** ADR-0014/0015, SPEC §7.12–13 + changelog, new `docs/SECRETS.md`
  credential inventory (+ README doc-map + a CLAUDE.md living-docs sync rule so
  SECRETS.md doesn't drift). The Go/distroless stack was deliberately **not**
  recorded in SPEC (human's call — app is incidental to the infra story).
- **Guardrails honored:** nothing billable applied; demo image **not** pushed
  (ECR login is a bring-up step); gitignored working files (`SPEC/PLAN/CLAUDE`)
  excluded from the commit; commit staged + message drafted for the human to
  finalize.
- **One bring-up check banked:** the `ExternalSecret` assumes `pg-app` keys
  `username`/`password`/`dbname` — confirm against the live CNPG secret at the
  "inspect connection secret" step before relying on them.

## 2026-06-04 (PM) — Live bring-up: full stack on AWS, end-to-end verified

- **Used for:** Driving the live bring-up under my step-by-step gating — KMS
  migration, all six OpenTofu layers, Ansible k3s HA, the ArgoCD/ApplicationSet
  GitOps phase, demo-app image push, and the end-to-end API test — plus
  diagnosing/fixing four issues the first live run surfaced.
- **Outcome:** All six ArgoCD apps Synced/Healthy by wave; CNPG Postgres 3/3 HA
  on EBS gp3; demo-app read/writes proven (`POST`/`GET /items`, rows confirmed
  in the `pg-1` primary). ADR-0016 (account-id-free ApplicationSet injection)
  **validated live** — the CMP fallback is retired.
- **Issues the LLM diagnosed + fixed (all gated through me, each its own commit):**
  - **ApplicationSet `name` collision:** in a `matrix`, the `clusters` generator's
    `name` (cluster name) shadowed the `list` element's `name` → all apps
    collapsed to one + the `eq .name "…"` branches died silently. Re-keyed to
    `appName`. The LLM traced this from the duplicate-`Application` error.
  - **ArgoCD self-prune cascade (the sharp edge of the above):** the mis-named app
    carried the wave -1 self-manage element; pruning it cascade-deleted
    `argocd-cm`/RBAC/SAs. Recovered by `helm upgrade --install` + controller
    restart (stale SA tokens) — LLM reasoned out the 401-Unauthorized → recreated-SA
    token-invalidation chain rather than rebuilding.
  - **EBS CSI sidecars:** repository-only override left the chart's `-eks-1-31-7`
    EKS-distro default tags, which 404 on the registry.k8s.io pull-through. Pinned
    plain upstream tags (verified each resolves through the cache before committing).
  - **ghcr.io pull-through (the planned "CNPG block"):** the `brzl-dev-github`
    rule didn't exist — ECR mandates a Secrets Manager credential for ghcr. **I**
    minted the `read:packages` PAT and ran the secret-creation + `40-ecr` apply
    myself (kept the token out of the agent transcript); the LLM took the ARN from
    there. Unblocked CNPG operator, external-secrets, AND the Postgres data image.
  - **demo-app `runAsUser`:** `runAsNonRoot` with no numeric uid fails on
    distroless:nonroot; pinned `65532`.
- **Recurring operational note captured:** an auto-sync app past its retry budget
  won't re-sync on hard-refresh — force via a `kubectl patch … operation` (now in
  RECOVERY.md).
- **Guardrails honored:** every billable/mutating step (tofu applies, the ghcr
  secret + 40-ecr re-apply, ArgoCD bootstrap, image push) was previewed and
  gated; I finalized + pushed every commit; account id never entered git.
- **Docs synced:** ADR-0016 "Validated live" addendum, RECOVERY.md ArgoCD
  control-plane recovery section, this entry. SECRETS.md/BOOTSTRAP.md already
  anticipated the ghcr step — no drift.

## 2026-06-04 (eve) — Observability + demo-app evolution (Sefaria search)

- **Used for:** Adding the monitoring stack and the app-level visibility the
  challenge wants, then evolving the demo-app so the dashboards show real traffic.
- **Monitoring (ADR-0017):** wave-1 kube-prometheus-stack via the ApplicationSet,
  Alertmanager trimmed, CNPG scraped (PodMonitor), CloudNativePG Grafana dashboard
  (gnetId 20417). Account-id hygiene reused ADR-0016 with a single
  `global.imageRegistry` injection (new `hostParams`); **all ~9 chart images
  verified through `helm template`** (→ `<host>/brzl-dev-*`, zero leaks) before
  apply. Needed the **Docker Hub pull-through** (Grafana + curl) — the human minted
  the token + ran the secret/40-ecr apply (token kept out of the agent transcript).
- **Three live UI bugs caught by exercising it, each root-caused not patched-over:**
  (1) ArgoCD UI wouldn't load — server runs `insecure`/HTTP, so the helper forwarded
  the wrong port; (2) Grafana login 401 — the chart's `adminPassword` default is a
  `randAlphaNum` that regenerates each render, so it drifted from the DB → switched
  to a bootstrap `grafana-admin` Secret via `existingSecret` (repo's no-secrets-in-git
  posture) + persistence off; (3) ApplicationSet `name` collision recurrence avoided.
  Also fixed the AppProject sourceRepos whitelist for the new chart repo.
- **demo-app → Sefaria search web app:** at the human's direction, **borrowed the
  search client from their `chofesh` CLI** (pure-stdlib, copied as an internal pkg).
  Added a server-rendered search UI, persisted searches + results + an outbound-call
  log to CNPG (instrumented `http.RoundTripper`), and app-level Prometheus metrics
  (+ ServiceMonitor). Smoke-tested locally (Postgres + a live search) before the
  image build; verified live (both pods scraped `-> up`), then a 45-search burst lit
  up the dashboards (48 searches / 253 results / 48 api_calls persisted).
- **Guardrails honored:** every mutating step (40-ecr apply, image push, ApplicationSet
  re-apply, syncs) previewed/gated; the human finalized + pushed every commit; no
  account id or token in git; `helm template` + local smoke tests de-risked offline.

## 2026-06-04 (night) — Teardown/DR test, state-bucket fix, local-dev (k3d) built

- **Used for:** Planning an operator-SSO gateway, then (on the human's redirect)
  pivoting to build the **local-dev environment** and run a full **teardown as a
  DR test**.
- **SSO gateway — planned, deferred to stretch:** designed the full portable SSO
  gate (Dex→GitHub + oauth2-proxy forward-auth + Traefik + Terraform NLB +
  cert-manager/Let's Encrypt + kube-API OIDC + RBAC tiers), establishing it needs
  **no IRSA** so it doesn't conflict with local-dev. The human chose to bank it as
  a stretch goal and prioritise local-dev — plan retained.
- **State-bucket fragility — caught + fixed at the source (human-directed):** a
  teardown `plan -destroy` failed `NoSuchBucket` because the `terraform_remote_state`
  data sources read `var.state_bucket` from a per-run `TF_VAR` I'd been hand-exporting
  and dropped. The human's principle: "if you can lose it, so can any operator." Fixed
  by **deriving the bucket from `data.aws_caller_identity`** in each `remote_state.tf`
  — no env var, account id still out of git. Noted in CLAUDE.md + memory.
- **Full teardown as a DR test:** captured a fresh pre-teardown CNPG backup +
  recorded the dataset acceptance target in RECOVERY.md, then destroyed everything
  below `15-kms` (`10`–`50`, including `40-ecr` — force-emptied the repos), keeping
  only the persistent backups + CMKs. Cost-leak swept the orphaned CSI EBS volumes;
  confirmed no NAT/EIP/ENI/pull-through residue. The dataset now rides entirely on
  the S3 backups (restore half is the A2 bring-up).
- **Local-dev (k3d) — built, ADR-0015 flipped:** a `gitops/clusters/local` kustomize
  overlay (upstream/imported images, `local-path`, backups+monitoring off, single
  Postgres) + an emit-commands `k3d_up.sh`, applied via `kubectl apply -k` (not the
  ECR-coupled ApplicationSet). Resolved one design point on contact — images go
  **upstream/`k3d image import`**, not "retain ECR", since the host-injection is
  AWS-only. Verified end-to-end **first try**: CNPG on local-path, ESO projection,
  demo-app search read/writes the local Postgres with `AWS_PROFILE` unset.
- **Guardrails:** the full teardown was previewed and run on the human's single
  "one go" approval; commits staged + drafted for them to finalize/push.

## 2026-06-04 (late) — Operator SSO gateway authored (Dex, local-first)

- **Used for:** Designing + authoring the full **operator-SSO gateway** on the
  local k3d cluster (ADR-0018) from the approved `composed-percolating-lemon.md`
  plan — one GitHub-backed sign-on in front of the cluster web UIs *and* the
  kube-API, with role tiers, real Let's Encrypt certs, portable to AWS.
- **What was produced:** `gitops/clusters/local/sso/` (Dex→GitHub issuer; three
  per-host oauth2-proxy reverse-proxy gates; Traefik IngressRoutes + http→https
  config; cert-manager LE issuers + wildcard `*.sso.barzel.sh` via the FreeDNS
  DNS-01 webhook; lean kube-prometheus-stack values + a stable Prometheus Service;
  kube-API OIDC RBAC), the `k3d_up.sh --with-sso` orchestration, `create_sso_secrets.sh`,
  and the docs (ADR-0018 + ACCESS/SECRETS/LOCAL/README). shellcheck + YAML clean.
- **Notable / human decisions:**
  - **Personal GitHub (no org)** chosen by the human → Dex emits no group claims,
    so I keyed the tiers on the **operator email** (oauth2-proxy allowlist + RBAC
    subject) and documented the org/team-group mapping as the one-line promotion.
  - **TLS on the human's own domain** `barzel.sh` (DNS on afraid.org) — I verified
    the FreeDNS DNS-01 webhook is viable for an owned domain (the wildcard limit
    only bites shared `*.afraid.org`), so the local build rehearses the *exact*
    cert-manager/DNS-01 path AWS will use; sslip.io+self-signed kept as fallback.
  - **Design correction mid-build:** dropped the planned Traefik forward-auth
    middleware tier (it 401s without redirecting to the IdP) for **per-host
    oauth2-proxy in full reverse-proxy mode** — the auto-redirecting, battle-tested
    pattern; also removed the need for any Traefik cross-namespace flag.
  - **k3d issuer-reachability** (the flagged risk) handled by giving the in-node
    API server the serverlb container IP for the Dex host via a post-create
    `/etc/hosts` patch, while oauth2-proxy skips OIDC discovery and reads token/JWKS
    over in-cluster Service DNS.
- **Pending (human):** GitHub OAuth App + FreeDNS cred + `/etc/hosts` are the
  one-time prereqs; live bring-up + 1–2 iterations to follow. All secrets flow in
  as env (never committed); commits staged + drafted for the human to finalize.

## 2026-06-09 — Live from-zero AWS bring-up + validation-driven hardening (conductor)

- **Used for:** Navigating a complete **from-zero AWS bring-up driven from the
  conductor** (account bootstrap → conductor → secrets → Terraform layers →
  Ansible/k3s HA → GitOps → seed) — the human drove every gated apply, I diagnosed
  and fixed each edge issue surfaced live — then finalized the Upgrade write-up (4d).
- **What was produced (every fix found by running the real path, not review):**
  - **20-security:** auto-detect the admin /32 via an `http` data source (dropped
    `TF_VAR_mycurrentip`) — works from the conductor (its public egress IP) or a laptop.
  - **EBS CMK ↔ EC2 Spot SLR:** the EBS key policy now grants `AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot`
    (the one principal IAM can't reach), so spot nodes attach their encrypted root
    volume; the SLR is resolved-or-created in `15-kms` (`modules/kms` gained
    `service_grant_principals`).
  - **Conductor cloud-init:** pre-create `ssm-user` in the `docker` group (SSM creates
    the user lazily, *after* the old runcmd usermod), install `session-manager-plugin`
    (Ansible reaches the nodes over SSH-over-SSM), install `k9s`.
  - **platform.sh:** fixed `printf '---'` (parsed as options — broke every preview
    header); the `gitops` phase now creates the `grafana-admin` Secret before the
    monitoring wave (was a silent manual prereq → Grafana stuck `CreateContainerConfigError`).
  - **Tooling:** `ui_forward.sh` prints the laptop-side SSM port-forward commands when
    run on the conductor; `seed_demo_data.sh` gained a self-contained `pf` mode
    (backgrounded forward, seed, torn down on exit); `create_pullthrough_secrets.sh`
    silenced the expected `ResourceExistsException` noise (the create-or-update was fine).
  - **Docs:** README/BOOTSTRAP spell out the evaluator-staged inputs (the ArgoCD repo
    deploy key especially — gitignored, NOT shipped to the conductor); SECRETS records
    the EBS-CMK Spot-SLR grant as the documented exception to IAM-only delegation;
    UPGRADE.md grounded in what the bring-up validated.
- **Outcome:** 7/7 ArgoCD apps Synced/Healthy (gp3 default; CNPG HA primary + 2
  streaming replicas; ESO projection; demo-app), data path seeded end-to-end
  (app→Sefaria→Postgres). The conductor execution-locus model (no repo credential;
  tree shipped via S3 + `brzl-fetch`) held up; spot capacity was unavailable in-region
  so the run used on-demand.
- **Notable / human decisions:**
  - Chose the **full validation from the conductor**, not the laptop shortcut.
  - On spot capacity-not-available, ran **on-demand** for the validation but had me wire
    the Spot-SLR grant so the spot path is robust for future cheap-iteration runs.
  - Flagged **grafana-admin into the `gitops` phase**, **k9s** on the toolbox,
    **`ui_forward` conductor→laptop chaining**, and a **self-contained seeder** — folded in.
  - Raised the **evaluator-handoff** gap (gitignored in-cluster secrets aren't shipped) →
    we documented them as pre-stage requirements rather than auto-provisioning (a
    Secrets-Manager-backed provisioning step noted as a follow-up, not a blocker).
  - On the Upgrade write-up: confirmed **no live upgrade test is needed** — the bring-up
    exercised every mechanism the upgrade paths use; only the version bumps (CNPG minor,
    k3s) are unrun, and those are the controllers' standard rolling behaviour.
- **Guardrails:** every billable apply/destroy gated + saved-plan; commits staged +
  drafted for the human to finalize/push; GUIDANCE.md kept untracked. Teardown to follow.

## 2026-06-10 — Delivery day: doc-truth alignment, time table, prod env built + validated live

- **Used for:** An interviewer-style evaluation of the repo against TASK.md, then
  closing what it found: docs aligned with the (better-than-documented) A2 reality,
  the required time table, and — the day's centerpiece — **authoring and live-validating
  the prod environment** (private-subnet nodes, NLB-only ingress; ADR-0019), human
  driving every gated step, LLM navigating. A hiccup ledger (gitignored
  `PROD_RUN_REPORT.md`) recorded every failure with its fix and doc destination.
- **Evaluation catches (LLM, then fixed together):** the README claimed an HPA that
  didn't exist (human reworded — honest "not implemented"); LEADERSHIP claimed "In CI
  today" with no CI (human reworded); README/RECOVERY said the restore drill was
  pending when it had **passed 2026-06-08** (LLM aligned both); the required time
  table was missing (LLM reconstructed `TIMETABLE.md` from session telemetry + git
  history); prod was `.gitkeep` stubs (became today's build).
- **Prod bring-up — every hiccup fixed at source, not patched in place:**
  - Stale DynamoDB state-**digest** rows from the prior teardown broke `tofu init`
    → swept; TEARDOWN.md leak-sweep gained the item.
  - **Three LLM authoring misses, each caught live:** prod `20-security` shipped
    without a `backend.tf` (layer silently applied into local state — fixed +
    `-migrate-state`; driver should preflight backend blocks); the prod
    ApplicationSet dropped dev's `hostParams` loop, then grew back a consumer
    (monitoring `InvalidImageName` — restored); and **monitoring was cut from prod
    without an explicit ask** — the human's "why?" reinstated it properly
    (`values-prod.yaml`, env-scoped prefixes). Lesson recorded: a scope cut needs a
    question, not a buried note.
  - Dev-hardcodings the prod run flushed out: `bootstrap_argocd.sh` (4 refs →
    `ENV`-parameterized), `platform.sh cluster` (inventory layer/file), `ansible.cfg`
    SSH key (→ per-env group var in the generated inventory), `kubeconfig_setup.sh`
    (env compute dir + private-IP fallback).
  - **Human directive — no operator-memory steps:** the kube-API tunnel for private
    nodes became driver-managed (`api_tunnel.sh`, self-scoping, called by every
    kubectl phase) after the LLM first offered a "run this in a second shell"
    recovery. Same posture for the deploy-key trip (bit its second run): now a hard
    gate in the `gitops` phase + symptom-first docs in BOOTSTRAP/README/RECOVERY.
  - ArgoCD operational lessons banked in RECOVERY.md: a hand-deleted Helm-hook Job
    wedges the in-flight sync (terminate-then-resync); a forced operation doesn't
    reliably honor `CreateNamespace`; `gitops()` now asserts the ApplicationSet
    exists (the emitted stream's `|| true` tail had masked a failure).
- **Design question by the human, answered honestly in ADR-0019:** a hand-applied
  ApplicationSet is *not* fully GitOps — felt three times today; the root-app fix is
  designed (include-globbed cluster-config app, `in-cluster.yaml` excluded) and
  deferred past delivery by the human's call against the clock.
- **Outcome:** prod 7/7 Synced/Healthy on private nodes, demo-app through the NLB,
  monitoring included. Docs link-swept after the human moved LEADERSHIP/TIMETABLE to
  root. Guardrails held: human drove every apply/sync, finalized every commit.
