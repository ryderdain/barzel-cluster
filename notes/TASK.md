# Lead Infrastructure Engineer – Home Challenge


#### Important Notes:

1. We do not expect from you any prior experience with confidential computing (CC). Think of anything that works now, works identically with CC.
2. Please use LLMs as you would use in daily work. However, document (either in the code, or in a code of LLM conduct, when you used the LLM).

## Delivery
Please provide a link to a github repository containing the solution(s).

1. Add code
2. Add Readme 
3. Add Time table with required time per relevant sub-task
4. Add leadership answers

## Context
At the company we deploy **secure confidential cloud environments** across:
- Bare metal servers in datacenters
- Private clouds
- Public clouds
Installations must be:
- Fully automated
- GitOps-driven
- Reproducible
- Secure by default
Infrastructure team deploy environments using:
- Terraform
- Ansible
- Docker
- Helm
- Kubernetes operators
You will lead a team of **3 DevOps engineers** responsible for deploying and operating these environments.

# Challenge Overview
Design and partially implement a **GitOps-based infrastructure platform** capable of deploying a **Kubernetes environment with an operator-managed stateful service**.
The goal is to demonstrate:
- Infrastructure architecture
- Automation quality
- Kubernetes operations maturity
- GitOps practices
- Operational thinking

# Scenario
A customer wants to deploy a **secure Kubernetes platform** capable of hosting applications with **stateful services**. Your team must build a **GitOps-driven deployment repository** that:

1. Provisions infrastructure
2. Installs Kubernetes
3. Deploys an operator
4. Uses the operator to manage a production-ready stateful service
5. Demonstrates lifecycle management (monitoring, backup, upgrades)

# Requirements

## 1. Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)
Provision infrastructure using Terraform.
You may choose one environment:
- Public cloud (e.g AWS)
- Bare Metal (e.g. Hetzner)
- Local VMs
Minimum infrastructure:
- 3 Kubernetes nodes
- networking
- SSH access
- firewall configuration
Terraform requirements:
- modular design
- environment separation (dev / prod)
- reusable modules
Example structure:
```
terraform/
  modules/
  environments/
    dev/
    prod/
```

## 2. Node Configuration (Ansible)
Use **Ansible** to configure nodes and bootstrap Kubernetes.
Tasks include:
- install container runtime
- install Kubernetes (e.g., k3s, talos or kubeadm)
- configure networking
- prepare cluster for GitOps
Structure example:
```
ansible/
  roles/
    base
    kubernetes
    security
  playbooks/
    bootstrap.yml
```

Playbooks should be:
- idempotent
- modular
- reusable

## 3. GitOps Deployment
Deploy cluster applications via **GitOps**.
You may use:
- **Argo CD (preferred)**
- **Flux**
GitOps responsibilities:
- install operators
- manage application manifests
- separate environments
Example structure:
```
gitops/
  clusters/
    dev
    prod
  infrastructure/
  applications/
```

## 4. Operator-Based Stateful Service
Instead of deploying a database via Helm, install and configure a **Kubernetes operator** that manages the lifecycle of a stateful service.
Recommended option:
- **CloudNativePG**
Alternative acceptable operators or an operator you used to work in the past:
- **Crunchy PostgreSQL for Kubernetes**

### Operator Requirements
The operator should manage:

#### Database cluster
Example:
- 3 PostgreSQL instances
- persistent volumes
- failover configuration

#### Backups
Configure automated backups:
- object storage
- scheduled backups
- restore procedure
Example targets:
- S3
- MinIO

#### Monitoring
Expose metrics compatible with:
- Prometheus
Monitoring setup may include:
- ServiceMonitor
- exporter

#### Upgrades
Demonstrate how upgrades would work:
- PostgreSQL minor upgrades
- rolling restart
- GitOps change management

## 5. Example Application
Deploy a simple application that connects to the operator-managed database.
Example:
- containerized REST API
- reads/writes data to Postgres
Application deployment should also be managed via GitOps.

## 1. Team Organization
How would you organize a **team of 3 DevOps engineers** deploying this platform?
Topics:
- roles
- review process
